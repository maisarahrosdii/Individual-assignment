            <h1>ROSDI'S FAMILY
            <br><div class="justified-text">The family is where individuals learn the values, morals, and beliefs that will guide them throughout their lives. It is where they learn to interact with others, to form relationships, and to develop a sense of self. It is also where individuals receive their first education, both formal and informal, as they learn from their parents and other family members.

            Deeply in my heart, my family is the best. I'd like to tell you a little bit about my family. My father works as an Prudential Insurance Takaful Agent at the Kota Bharu, Kelantan. Meanwhile, my mother is self-employed by selling woman handbag. Indeed, we siblings understand the fatigue of our parents who worked hard to support us all. I have 1 young brother and 1 young sister and i was the oldest. My sister is 8 years old and study at SKSRP(1) and my brother is 16 years old study at SMKRP(1). My parents have the same goal of seeing their children flourish and have a happy life one day. My family is the best family on the world. <br><br>
