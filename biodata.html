    <h3><br>MY HOBBY (cooking)<br>
    <br><div class="justified-text">For me, cooking is a relaxing and therapeutic activity, allowing me to focus on the present moment and forget about their daily stressors. Additionally, many people enjoy the social aspect of cooking, as it allows them to share their creations with friends and family and bond over a shared meal.
        <br><br>
    Another reason why cooking is considered as my hobby is because it can be done at any level, whether you are a beginner or an experienced cook. Cooking is a hobby that can be tailored to your own skills and interests, and it's a hobby that you can continue to grow and develop as you learn new techniques, recipes, and cuisines. Cooking can also be a form of self-care as it can be a way to relax and de-stress after a long day, and also can be a way to express yourself and to be creative.
